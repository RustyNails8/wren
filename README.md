# Rhett ✏️

Rhett is a note taking application and a to-do management system that is ridiculously simple, yet so advanced.

It is simple because every note is just a file. The filename is the title, and the content is the note's content. Forget about HTML, Markdown - we're talking plain text. Just write. Rhett uses the good old cron syntax to support routine tasks, and normal timestamps to support future tasks.

It is advanced because it is very extensible - it comes (optionally!) with a Telegram bot that you can chat with to manage your notes, and even get AI-driven daily summaries. It also includes a tiny HTTP server that you can use to manage tasks using an API or from the browser.
